Process Mining
- process inefficiencies questions:
	- Where are the bottlenecks in the process?
	- What is causing some cases to run late?
	- Which resources are overloaded?
	- Which activities are skipped more often?
	- Which resources create deviations?

- quantifying the impact of variants and inefficiencies
	- How does this particular variant impact a certain process KPI, such as operational cost? 
	- How does automation shorten the process cycle time?
	- What percentage of steps in the process are automated?
	- What percentage of cases are following the established process, and what’s the percentage that don’t conform?


Benchmark things after
- Compare before and after (or at least project 30%, 50%, 70%)

Check best practice through conformity
