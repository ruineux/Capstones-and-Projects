Strategic Consulting vs. Management Consulting

Strategic Consulting
- What do we work on?
	- All Strategic Consultants are Management Consultant but not all Management consultants are Strategy Consultant
- Works with Executives (C-Levels)
- Exposed with difficult problems
- Tends to move from plan to another

Mangement Consulting
- What we work on?
- How we work on it?
- If you wanna remain
- Operations centered 
- More standard


Case Scenario
- Tequila Company with 150 countries reach
	- They would like to know out of which countries should be number 151?

- They will hire Strategy Consultants
	- Will do some analysis
	- Recommend a country based on analysis
	- This ends the (What we can work on?) and move to the next business question (How can they launch on the country specified by the Strategy Consultants)

- How can they actually do this?
	- Hire a Management Consultant that specializes in
		- Supply Chain = How to get the product from one place to another
		- Sales Expert Consultant = Figure out their sales team in the new branch
		- Risk Management = What are the Risk? How do they work on with the government in the country? Black markets? Fake products?
